# The decks as built

The great-person deck of secret techs and the Armageddon deck: how they work in the code, and
how a card is added. The design, the owner's verdicts and every card's spec are in
`docs/DECKS.md` and `docs/DECKS_ROUND8.md`; this file is the implementation.

## 1. The great-person deck

**A card is a tech** with a `card_suit` (`TechInfo::card`, `crates/ffh-data/src/infos/civics.rs`).
A card tech is never researched or traded: the reader forces `disable` and `!trade`.

- **Suit:** `card_suit` is the unit class of the great person that draws it:

  | Suit | Class |
  |---|---|
  | Sage | `UNITCLASS_SCIENTIST` |
  | Prophet | `UNITCLASS_PROPHET` |
  | Engineer | `UNITCLASS_ENGINEER` |
  | Merchant | `UNITCLASS_MERCHANT` |
  | Bard | `UNITCLASS_ARTIST` |

- **Band:** the tech's `era` (I `ERA_ANCIENT`, II `ERA_CLASSICAL`, III `ERA_MEDIEVAL`).
- **Needs:** the tech's `and_pre_reqs` / `or_pre_reqs`, the ordinary techs its content needs. A
  card is discovered only once its owner knows them.
- **Alignment:** `card_alignment` (`ALIGNMENT_GOOD`, `ALIGNMENT_EVIL`) limits who draws it.
- **Faith:** `card_religion` names a religion card. It is drawn whatever the drawer's
  religion; discovering it spreads the religion to three of the owner's cities without it, the
  most populous first.

**Content gates on the card tech.** A card's units, buildings, promotions, spells, civics,
improvements and projects name the card tech as their tech prerequisite (`prereq_tech`,
`tech_prereq`, ...). Rules code tests `team_is_has_tech(team, Some(card))`. Since the card
cannot be discovered before its needs, nothing else needs to require them.

**The deal** (`crates/ffh-core/src/deck/mod.rs`):
- A great person of a suit is dealt a card at birth (`player_init_unit` ->
  `deck_deal_to_unit`). It is held in `Unit::card`.
- The deck has no state of its own. A card is in it while no team knows the card and no living
  unit holds it. A card whose great person dies, or is used another way, is back in the deck.
- **Draw:** from the cards of the suit still in the deck, of the player's alignment, in the
  band of the player's era (Medieval and later count as III). If that band is empty, the nearest
  band below is used, else the nearest above. One `soren_rand_num` over the candidates in id
  order.

**Discover:** `SPELL_DISCOVER_CARD` (`data/json/cards/000_deck.jsonc`). Its requirement is
`unit_can_discover_card`; its result is `unit_discover_card` (the team learns the card, the
religion spreads); `sacrifice_caster` uses the great person up.

**AI** (`crates/ffh-ai/src/cards.rs`):
- A great person discovers its card as soon as it can.
- The card's missing needs pull research (`research::goal_bonus`, `CARD_SCORE`).
- A great person under 30 turns old whose needs are at most two near techs away waits in the
  capital. Otherwise it is used the old way, and its card goes back into the deck.
- Each card's own content needs its own AI use. That goes in `ffh-ai`, next to the system it
  belongs to (production, casting, research). A card batch's own AI (when to cast its world
  spells and at what, which rituals to build) goes in a module of its own, `ffh-ai/src/cards_<batch>.rs`,
  with its turn function added to `cards::TURNS` (run once a turn, after the empire decisions).
  A rules change is not gated on the AI (CLAUDE.md, "AI changes").

## 2. A card's files

**Data:** one file per card, `data/json/cards/<suit>_<name>.jsonc` (`sage_abjurer.jsonc`).
The loader (`add_card_files`, `crates/ffh-data/src/lib.rs`) appends each member's entries to its
info table, after the table's own entries, files in name order:
- each member is an info table, named as its file is without `.jsonc` (`techs`, `units`,
  `unit_classes`, `promotions`, `buildings`, `building_classes`, `spells`, `improvements`,
  `builds`, `civics`, `projects`, `civilizations`, `leader_heads`, ...);
- `text` is an object of the card's English text (TXT_KEY -> string).

A card's file holds its tech and everything the card adds. The tech is
`TECH_CARD_<NAME>`, its name `TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_<NAME>`, and its `help` is the card's effect in
bare rules text (CLAUDE.md, "Rules text and tooltips").

```jsonc
// G05 Abjurer (docs/DECKS_ROUND8.md)
{
  "techs": [
    {
      "type": "TECH_CARD_ABJURER",
      "description": "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER",
      "help": "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_HELP",
      "civilopedia": "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_PEDIA",
      "advisor": "ADVISOR_SCIENCE",
      "cost": -1,
      "advanced_start_cost": -1,
      "era": "ERA_CLASSICAL",
      "and_pre_reqs": ["TECH_ALTERATION"],
      "card_suit": "UNITCLASS_SCIENTIST",
      "flavors": {"FLAVOR_SCIENCE": 1}
    }
  ],
  "promotions": [ /* PROMOTION_ABJURER, "tech_prereq": "TECH_CARD_ABJURER", ... */ ],
  "text": {
    "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER": "Abjurer",
    "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_HELP": "...",
    "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_PEDIA": "..."
  }
}
```

**Rules code:** a card's callbacks (`py_result`, `py_requirement`, `py_targets`, promotion
`py_per_turn`) go in `crates/ffh-core/src/ffh/cards/<suit>.rs`. Each module registers them by name
in its `find_*` lookups. Rules that are not callbacks go where the rule they change lives, with a
comment naming the card.

**Records:** each card that changes the rules is listed in docs/PORTING.md ("Changes from
FFH2", the decks entry). Its row in section 5 below gets its status.

**New data keys** (each has its reader; the loader warns about any key nothing reads):

| Table | Key | What |
|---|---|---|
| `civilizations` | `unit_promotion` | a promotion every land unit of the civilization gets when it is created (`unit_init`) |
| `traits` | `unit_rush_gold` | its player buys units at this many gold per hammer left, under any civic (the hurry rules) |
| `buildings` | `defender_defense` | percent more defence for the units fighting in the city (the most of its buildings; an engagement's defence terms) |

## 3. Card world spells and remote targets

- **A card's world spell** is a spell with `"once": true` and `"tech_prereq"` its card. Any unit of
  its owner can cast it, once a game. Its flag is its own (`Player::once_spells`), never the
  civilization's world spell (`global`, `FEAT_GLOBAL_SPELL`).
- **A spell cast at a distance** names its target kind, `"target"`: `plot`, `city`, `unit`,
  `player` or `choice` (one of its own numbered options). It also names the callback listing the
  valid targets for a caster, `"py_targets"`: a `TargetsFn`, `fn(&Game, UnitId, &PyCall) ->
  Vec<SpellTarget>`.
  - `unit_can_cast` passes only while there is a valid target.
  - `unit_cast_at(u, spell, target)` sets `Game::spell_target` for the spell's result to read.
  - A targeted spell cast without a target does nothing.
- **Shared helpers** for the cards go in `crates/ffh-core/src/ffh/cards/world.rs`: a region (the
  largest connected group of unowned plots of a terrain or feature), city sites, a new
  civilization born mid-game (section 6), ...

## 4. The Armageddon deck

`crates/ffh-core/src/deck/doom.rs`; its state is `Game::doom`.

- **Slots:** 10, 20, ... 90, and 100 for the ending: one card each, or none.
- **The deal:** on the first turn, slot by slot from the lowest, one card from those whose
  first threshold is the slot. A chain's later stages take the later slots they name; a chain
  is dealt only where those slots are free.
- **Reveal:** every player is shown a card once the counter (`get_global_counter`) is within 5 of
  its slot. A card whose `valid` fails then is dealt again from its slot's cards, or the slot
  stays empty.
- **Firing:** once, when the counter first reaches the slot (`doom_do_turn`, each game turn).
- **The cards** are code: `doom::CARDS` holds FFH2's events (Blight, the Four Horsemen as one
  chain, Hellfire, Wrath, Apocalypse), and `doom_cards::CARDS` the new ones. Each card has a key
  `DOOM_<NAME>`, its thresholds, what each stage does, and an optional condition. Its text is
  `TXT_KEY_DOOM_<NAME>` (the name) and `TXT_KEY_DOOM_<NAME>_HELP` (the effect), in a card file's
  `text`.
- **Sight:** a player may see unrevealed slots ahead (`doom_slot_known`, `player_doom_sight`:
  the Orrery of Ceridwen shows two).
- FFH2's counter triggers (`prereq_global_counter`, weight -1) no longer fire by themselves.

**Random events are gone:** `player_do_events` no longer rolls for a weighted event. The
triggers rules code fires itself still work: the Adaptive and Insane traits, lairs, the
always-firing triggers without a counter threshold.

## 5. Status

Which cards are built. The specs are in docs/DECKS_ROUND8.md (round 8: G, P, E, M, B and A
ids) and docs/DECKS.md (sections 3, 9.4, 10.1, 12, 13).

| Card | Suit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| (the deck itself: deal, discover, once spells, targets, Armageddon deck) | | built |
| G12 The Patrian Awakening | Sage | built (batch B4) |
| P18 Founding of the Dawn Knights | Prophet | built (batch B4) |
| P19 The Fey Court Awakens | Prophet | built (batch B4) |
| M07 The Condottieri Free State | Merchant | built (batch B4) |
| Free City Charter (reworked) | Engineer | built (batch B4) |
| Mirror Colony | Sage | built (batch B4) |

## 6. New civilizations

`world::birth(g, &Birth)` gives a new civilization a player slot mid-game; the cards of batch B4
(`cards/new_civs.rs`) use it, and later cards can.

- **The slot:** `world::open_slot`, a spare slot never alive (`GameSetup::SPARE_SLOTS`, 4, shared
  with Hyborem and Basium; never a crusade Host's). With none free, a card that makes a
  civilization cannot be cast: its requirement tests the slot.
- **Who it is:** a civilization and a leader of its own (`civilizations` and `leader_heads` in the
  card's file; neither playable nor AI-playable, so no game starts with it and no colony takes it).
  The slot is added as the Infernals' is (`add_player_advanced`, on a team of its own) and played
  by the founder's controller. Its parent is the founder (`Player::parent`).
- **What it starts with** (`Birth`): the cities it founds at given plots (`NewCity`: the first its
  capital, each with its buildings and units), or cities of the founder it takes over (`release`:
  a trade, so they keep their buildings, with their culture and garrison: the founder's land
  combat units in them but heroes and the caster), a hero in its capital, every tech the founder's
  team knows but the cards (and `techs`), a state religion in all its cities, gold.
- **Its relation to the founder:** it has met it. As a vassal (`vassal`) it is the founder's, by
  the ordinary vassal rules (it joins its master's wars). **Where vassals cannot be** (No Vassal
  States, or a founder that is a vassal itself) it signs open borders and a defensive pact with the
  founder instead, a deal like any other. No other war or peace is forced (docs/DECKS.md, principle
  27): its leanings are attitude modifiers, toward the founder (`ai_attitude_extra`) and toward
  every civilization of an alignment (`Player::alignment_attitude`).
- **The AI's attitude** (`ffh-ai`, `diplomacy::relation_parts`) counts both, at half (they are on
  FFH's scale, where 4 is about a step; the AI's step is 2, as for the Trust spell).
- **City sites** (`world::free_site`, `site_value`, `best_sites`, `near_borders`): a free site is
  land a city can stand on (`player_can_found`'s terrain, feature, peak, permanent improvement and
  mana rules), with no unit, no city within `MIN_CITY_RANGE`, unowned; the best are taken by the
  land, bonuses, water and fresh water in their radius.
- **Its own rules** are data where they can be: a civilization's `unit_promotion` (the Fey
  Glamour, the Dawn Vow), a civilization trait (`civ_trait`: the Free Companies'), a palace's
  `free_building` (the Patrians' Mage Guilds), unique units in its `units`. What data cannot say is
  a rule hooked where it lives (section 2), each naming its card.
- **Art:** a new leader shows an existing leader's portrait and a new unit an existing unit's
  sprite (`PORTRAIT_ALIASES` in `crates/ffh-play/assets/app/portraits.js`, `UNIT_ALIASES` in
  `iso.js`).
