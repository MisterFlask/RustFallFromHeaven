# The decks as built

The great-person deck of secret techs and the Armageddon deck: how they work in the code, and
how a card is added. The design, the owner's verdicts and every card's spec are in
`docs/DECKS.md` and `docs/DECKS_ROUND8.md`; this file is the implementation.

## 1. The great-person deck

**A card is a tech** with a `card_suit` (`TechInfo::card`, `crates/ffh-data/src/infos/civics.rs`).
A card tech is never researched or traded: the reader forces `disable` and `!trade`.

- **Suit:** `card_suit` is the unit class of the great person that draws it:

  | Suit | Class |
  |---|---|
  | Sage | `UNITCLASS_SCIENTIST` |
  | Prophet | `UNITCLASS_PROPHET` |
  | Engineer | `UNITCLASS_ENGINEER` |
  | Merchant | `UNITCLASS_MERCHANT` |
  | Bard | `UNITCLASS_ARTIST` |

- **Band:** the tech's `era` (I `ERA_ANCIENT`, II `ERA_CLASSICAL`, III `ERA_MEDIEVAL`).
- **Needs:** the tech's `and_pre_reqs` / `or_pre_reqs`, the ordinary techs its content needs. A
  card is discovered only once its owner knows them.
- **Alignment:** `card_alignment` (`ALIGNMENT_GOOD`, `ALIGNMENT_EVIL`) limits who draws it.
- **Faith:** `card_religion` names a religion card. It is drawn whatever the drawer's
  religion; discovering it spreads the religion to three of the owner's cities without it, the
  most populous first.

**Content gates on the card tech.** A card's units, buildings, promotions, spells, civics,
improvements and projects name the card tech as their tech prerequisite (`prereq_tech`,
`tech_prereq`, ...). Rules code tests `team_is_has_tech(team, Some(card))`. Since the card
cannot be discovered before its needs, nothing else needs to require them.

**The deal** (`crates/ffh-core/src/deck/mod.rs`):
- A great person of a suit is dealt a card at birth (`player_init_unit` ->
  `deck_deal_to_unit`). It is held in `Unit::card`.
- The deck has no state of its own. A card is in it while no team knows the card and no living
  unit holds it. A card whose great person dies, or is used another way, is back in the deck.
- **Draw:** from the cards of the suit still in the deck, of the player's alignment, in the
  band of the player's era (Medieval and later count as III). If that band is empty, the nearest
  band below is used, else the nearest above. One `soren_rand_num` over the candidates in id
  order.

**Discover:** `SPELL_DISCOVER_CARD` (`data/json/cards/000_deck.jsonc`). Its requirement is
`unit_can_discover_card`; its result is `unit_discover_card` (the team learns the card, the
religion spreads); `sacrifice_caster` uses the great person up.

**AI** (`crates/ffh-ai/src/cards.rs`):
- A great person discovers its card as soon as it can.
- The card's missing needs pull research (`research::goal_bonus`, `CARD_SCORE`).
- A great person under 30 turns old whose needs are at most two near techs away waits in the
  capital. Otherwise it is used the old way, and its card goes back into the deck.
- Each card's own content needs its own AI use. That goes in `ffh-ai`, next to the system it
  belongs to (production, casting, research). A card batch's own AI (when to cast its world
  spells and at what, which rituals to build) goes in a module of its own, `ffh-ai/src/cards_<batch>.rs`,
  with its turn function added to `cards::TURNS` (run once a turn, after the empire decisions).
  A rules change is not gated on the AI (CLAUDE.md, "AI changes").

## 2. A card's files

**Data:** one file per card, `data/json/cards/<suit>_<name>.jsonc` (`sage_abjurer.jsonc`).
The loader (`add_card_files`, `crates/ffh-data/src/lib.rs`) appends each member's entries to its
info table, after the table's own entries, files in name order:
- each member is an info table, named as its file is without `.jsonc` (`techs`, `units`,
  `unit_classes`, `promotions`, `buildings`, `building_classes`, `spells`, `improvements`,
  `builds`, `civics`, `projects`, `civilizations`, `leader_heads`, ...);
- `text` is an object of the card's English text (TXT_KEY -> string).

A card's file holds its tech and everything the card adds. The tech is
`TECH_CARD_<NAME>`, its name `TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_<NAME>`, and its `help` is the card's effect in
bare rules text (CLAUDE.md, "Rules text and tooltips").

```jsonc
// G05 Abjurer (docs/DECKS_ROUND8.md)
{
  "techs": [
    {
      "type": "TECH_CARD_ABJURER",
      "description": "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER",
      "help": "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_HELP",
      "civilopedia": "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_PEDIA",
      "advisor": "ADVISOR_SCIENCE",
      "cost": -1,
      "advanced_start_cost": -1,
      "era": "ERA_CLASSICAL",
      "and_pre_reqs": ["TECH_ALTERATION"],
      "card_suit": "UNITCLASS_SCIENTIST",
      "flavors": {"FLAVOR_SCIENCE": 1}
    }
  ],
  "promotions": [ /* PROMOTION_ABJURER, "tech_prereq": "TECH_CARD_ABJURER", ... */ ],
  "text": {
    "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER": "Abjurer",
    "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_HELP": "...",
    "TXT_KEY_TECH_CARD_ABJURER_PEDIA": "..."
  }
}
```

**Rules code:** a card's callbacks (`py_result`, `py_requirement`, `py_targets`, promotion
`py_per_turn`) go in `crates/ffh-core/src/ffh/cards/<suit>.rs`. Each module registers them by name
in its `find_*` lookups. Rules that are not callbacks go where the rule they change lives, with a
comment naming the card.

**Records:** each card that changes the rules is listed in docs/PORTING.md ("Changes from
FFH2", the decks entry). Its row in section 5 below gets its status.

**New data keys** (each read in `ffh-data`; the loader warns about a key nothing reads):

| Table | Key | Value | Read as | Card |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| improvements | `deep_spawn_unit_type` | a unit type | `ImprovementInfo::deep_spawn_unit_type` | what a lair spawns once The Lairs Deepen has been played (every lair has one) |
| buildings | `global_counter_commerces` | commerces | `BuildingInfo::global_counter_commerce` | its city's commerce per 10 points of the Armageddon counter (the Orrery of Ceridwen) |
| buildings | `doom_sight` | int | `BuildingInfo::doom_sight` | how many unrevealed Armageddon cards ahead its owner sees (the Orrery: 2) |

## 3. Card world spells and remote targets

- **A card's world spell** is a spell with `"once": true` and `"tech_prereq"` its card. Any unit of
  its owner can cast it, once a game. Its flag is its own (`Player::once_spells`), never the
  civilization's world spell (`global`, `FEAT_GLOBAL_SPELL`).
- **A spell cast at a distance** names its target kind, `"target"`: `plot`, `city`, `unit`,
  `player` or `choice` (one of its own numbered options). It also names the callback listing the
  valid targets for a caster, `"py_targets"`: a `TargetsFn`, `fn(&Game, UnitId, &PyCall) ->
  Vec<SpellTarget>`.
  - `unit_can_cast` passes only while there is a valid target.
  - `unit_cast_at(u, spell, target)` sets `Game::spell_target` for the spell's result to read.
  - A targeted spell cast without a target does nothing.
- **Shared helpers** for the cards go in `crates/ffh-core/src/ffh/cards/world.rs`: a region (the
  largest connected group of unowned plots of a terrain or feature), a new civilization born
  mid-game, ...

## 4. The Armageddon deck

`crates/ffh-core/src/deck/doom.rs`; its state is `Game::doom`.

- **Slots:** 10, 20, ... 90, and 100 for the ending: one card each, or none.
- **The deal:** on the first turn, slot by slot from the lowest, one card from those whose
  first threshold is the slot. A chain's later stages take the later slots they name; a chain
  is dealt only where those slots are free.
- **Reveal:** every player is shown a card once the counter (`get_global_counter`) is within 5 of
  its slot. A card whose `valid` fails then is dealt again from its slot's cards, or the slot
  stays empty.
- **Firing:** once, when the counter first reaches the slot (`doom_do_turn`, each game turn).
- **The cards** are code: `doom::CARDS` holds FFH2's events (Blight, the Four Horsemen as one
  chain, Hellfire, Wrath, Apocalypse), and `doom_cards::CARDS` the new ones. Each card has a key
  `DOOM_<NAME>`, its thresholds, what each stage does, and an optional condition. Its text is
  `TXT_KEY_DOOM_<NAME>` (the name) and `TXT_KEY_DOOM_<NAME>_HELP` (the effect), in a card file's
  `text`.
- **Sight:** a player may see unrevealed cards ahead (`doom_slot_known`: the next unrevealed
  slots that hold a card; `player_doom_sight` -> `doom_cards::doom_sight`, the most any of the
  player's buildings shows by its `doom_sight`: the Orrery of Ceridwen, two).
- **Named at the reveal:** a card whose targets must be known before it plays (a sea, six hills)
  has an `on_reveal` hook. It is called when its slot is revealed (after a redeal, for the card
  that stays) and returns the targets, which the slot keeps (`DoomSlot::targets`, saved: plot
  indices for the cards so far). Its fire reads them back with `Game::doom_targets(key, stage)`.
  A redeal clears a slot's targets.
- **Lasting cards:** a card whose effect lasts for the rest of the game (The Lairs Deepen, The
  Long Night) fires nothing itself; the rule it changes asks `Game::doom_fired(key)` where the
  rule lives, with a comment naming the card.
- **No barbarians:** a card that brings barbarian units (The Wild Awakens, Werewolf Moon, The
  Blade Returns, The Lairs Deepen) is not valid under No Barbarians, so it is dealt again.
- **The deal with the new cards:** slots 20, 30, ... 100 always hold a card, but 70, which only
  the Four Horsemen's chain reaches (a test checks this); slot 10 has none. A slot's cards share
  it evenly: 30 Blight or the Sea Recedes, 40 three ways (Volcanic Spring, Werewolf Moon, the
  Horsemen, who then take 50-70), 100 four ways.
- **The Gathering's vassals** are marked (`Team::gathered`, saved; cleared when freed): they do
  not count toward their master's domination victory (`team_victory_population`,
  `team_victory_land`) or conquest victory.
- FFH2's counter triggers (`prereq_global_counter`, weight -1) no longer fire by themselves.

**Random events are gone:** `player_do_events` no longer rolls for a weighted event. The
triggers rules code fires itself still work: the Adaptive and Insane traits, lairs, the
always-firing triggers without a counter threshold. Crime, which only gated random events, is
gone too: no state, no `crime` / `prereq_crime` data keys, no help line.
